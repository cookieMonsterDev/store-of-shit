## Terms and Acronyms

Contains terms and acronyms relevant to linux 

* **Kernel** - is the core component of the operating system, responsible for managing system resources and enabling communication between hardware and software. It acts as a bridge between applications and the physical hardware of a computer.

*  **Linux distribution** - is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel and often a package management system. They are often obtained from the website of each distribution, which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for example, Linux Mint) to servers (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and powerful supercomputers (for example, Rocks Cluster Distribution). 

*  **Boot loader** - is a small program that loads the operating system (OS) into memory when a computer is powered on or restarted. It is the first software that runs after the computer's BIOS/UEFI has initialized the hardware. The boot loader's primary purpose is to load and transfer control to the kernel of the operating system, which then takes over and starts up the system.

*  **Service** - is a program or process that runs in the background and performs specific tasks without user interaction. Services are typically used to provide continuous functionality to other applications, the operating system, or network users e.g. httpd, nfsd, ntpd, ftpd, and named.

* **Filesysthem** - is a method and structure used by an operating system to manage, store, organize, and retrieve data on a storage device (such as a hard drive, SSD, or USB stick). It defines how data is stored on the device, how files are named, and how they are organized into directories (or folders). Examples of file system: ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS, NTFS and Btrfs.

* **X Window System** - (often referred to simply as X11 or X) is a foundational framework that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and BSD). It allows for the graphical display of applications on a screen and manages input devices like keyboards and mice. X is highly network-transparent, meaning you can run applications on one machine and display them on another over a network.

* **Desktop Environment** -  is a suite of software that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the operating system. It includes essential components like a window manager, icons, toolbars, file managers, and often various built-in applications. Examples of desktop environments: GNOME, KDE, Xfce and Fluxbox.

* **Command Line** - is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system or software. Instead of using graphical elements like icons and buttons, users type commands into a terminal or command-line interface (CLI) to execute tasks. The command line is a powerful tool that gives users more control and flexibility over the system, allowing them to perform complex operations efficiently.

* **Shell** - is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for interacting with the operating system. It allows users to execute commands, run programs, and manage the system by typing commands in a terminal. The shell acts as a bridge between the user and the underlying operating system, translating the commands entered into actions that the system can perform.
Examples of shells: bash, tcsh and zsh.
